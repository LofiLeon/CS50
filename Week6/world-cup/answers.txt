Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

That 100 simulations is faster than 10 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 100000. Before that i did not even have values for all teams, what does not make sense.
